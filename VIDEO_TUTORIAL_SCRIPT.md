4. Type 'npm run dev' and press Enter

[Wait for server to start]

Look! A popup says 'Your application running on port 3000 is available'

2. Click 'page.tsx' to open it
3. Find the line that says 'Your Favorite Stars'
4. Change it to 'Zimbabwe's Biggest Stars'
5. Press Control+S to save

[Switch to browser tab]

Look at that - the page automatically updated! This is called Hot Module Replacement. Every change you make appears instantly.

[Switch back to editor]

That's the power of Codespaces - a full development environment with hot reload, TypeScript support, and all the tools you need, running entirely in the cloud."
